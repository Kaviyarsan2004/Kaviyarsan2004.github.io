## Overview
Implemented a basic calculator on a Basys 3 FPGA board using VHDL, integrating a seven-segment display driver, hex-to-seven-segment decoder, and a multiplier. Leveraged FPGA hardware for hands-on experience in digital design and implementation.

## Achievements and Contributions
#### Design and Development:
- **Developed VHDL modules for**
  * Seven-Segment Display Driver
  * Hex-to-Seven-Segment Decoder
  * Multiplier
  * Utilized switches (SW) 7 downto 4 and 3 downto 0 to represent values on specific seven-segment displays.

- **Hardware Integration:**
  * Integrated necessary components like synchronizers, debouncers, and pulsers for reliable button handling (btnD) and reset mechanism (btnC).

- **Project Management:**
   * Led the team in project planning, task delegation, and ensuring successful implementation.
   * Ensured effective communication and collaboration among team members for seamless integration of modules.
